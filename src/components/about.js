              <p className='about-paragraph'>
                Generalized Additive Models (GAM) are a flexible class of statistical models that extend the
                traditional linear regression framework by allowing for non-linear relationships between predictors
                and the response variable. GAM models are particularly useful when the relationship between the
                predictors and the response is complex and cannot be adequately captured by simple linear
                relationships. By incorporating smooth functions of the predictors, GAM models can capture
                non-linear patterns, interactions, and complex dependencies in the data. This makes them
                a powerful tool for various applications, including regression and classification problems.

              <h2 className='about-headings'>Random Forest Regression (RFR) Introduction</h2>
              <p className='about-paragraph'>
                Random Forest Regression (RFR) is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision
                trees to create a robust and accurate regression model. In RFR, each decision tree is constructed
                using a random subset of the training data and a random subset of the predictors. By averaging
                the predictions of these individual trees, RFR reduces the risk of overfitting and improves the
                model's generalization ability. Random Forest Regression is known for its ability to handle
                high-dimensional datasets, capture non-linear relationships, and handle missing values effectively.

              <h2 className='about-headings'>XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) Introduction</h2>
              <p className='about-paragraph'>
                XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a powerful and efficient gradient boosting framework widely
                used for regression and classification tasks. It builds an ensemble of weak prediction models,
                typically decision trees, in a sequential manner. XGBoost uses gradient descent optimization to
                minimize a loss function and iteratively adds new weak models that focus on the samples with
                the highest prediction errors. This iterative boosting process results in a highly accurate and
                robust model. XGBoost incorporates regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and offers
                flexibility in handling missing data and incorporating user-defined evaluation metrics.

              <h2 className='about-headings'>Support Vector Regression (SVR) Introduction</h2>
              <p className='about-paragraph'>
                Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a powerful machine learning algorithm that extends the concept
                of Support Vector Machines (SVM) to regression problems. SVR aims to find a hyperplane that best
                fits the data while minimizing the margin violations. It is particularly effective in handling
                non-linear relationships and complex patterns in the data. By utilizing the kernel trick, SVR can
                map the original data into a higher-dimensional space, allowing for the capture of non-linear
                dependencies between predictors and the response variable.

              <p className='about-paragraph'>
                Linear Regression is a fundamental and widely used statistical model for understanding and
                predicting the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
                It assumes a linear relationship between the predictors and the response, aiming to find the
                best-fit line that minimizes the sum of squared residuals. Linear Regression provides interpretable
                coefficients that indicate the magnitude and direction of the relationship between the predictors
                and the response. It is a simple yet effective method for modeling and making predictions when
                the relationship between the variables is linear.
